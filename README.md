##OccupyTheSystem.Org
OccupyTheSystem.Org is a resource that provides an interface for exploring legislative data, and discuss it with other users on the site. We believe that real change in government will come from civic engagement and an informed electorate. We will be updating this documentation as well as the Wiki over time to provide insight into how the site works, and how best you as a devleoper can get involved.
